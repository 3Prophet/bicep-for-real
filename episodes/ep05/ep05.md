## Containers Part 2

stateContainerName created in cosmos db to store DAPR state

To reference an existing resource using its name:

```
resource cosmosDbAccount 'Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts@2021-03-15' existing = {
  name: cosmosAccountName
}

var cosmosDbKey = cosmosDbAccount.listKeys().primaryMasterKey
```

If resource is in different resource group, one can use `scope` attribute on an existing resource

After setting up  container app we need to adjust NSGs to allow traffic on its port 443 (ingress is set to external availability)
