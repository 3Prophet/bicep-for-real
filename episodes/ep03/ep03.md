## Databases

### Database requirements
* SQL API
* Session Consistency
* Single orders container
* ID partition key

### Infrastructure Requirements
* Serverless, at least for Dev to make things cheaper but may be slow
* Add multi-region support later

### Creating cosmos db account

For Cosmos DB we need a cosmosDbAccount resource `res-cosmos-account`. Change defaultConsistencyLevel to 'Session', enableAutomaticFailover: false. In  capabilities change to name: 'EnableServerless'

Cosmos db `res-cosmos-sql-database` is a subresource of the cosmosDbAccount, hence for the former we can take name `${prefix}-cosmos-account` whereas for the latter: `${prefix}-cosmos-account/${prefix}-sqldb`.
We remove throughput from options, because it will be serverless

`res-cosmos-sql-container`
Container is subresource of sqlDB. To avoid concatenating names to make child name. One can define
parent through parent attribute and give normal name to a resourse. We remove indexing policy

### Making private endpoints to DB

We need to setup a DNS to resolve private records for a resource. We create Azure private DNS, create a zone, link it to a private network and link it to the private endpoint and it will create a record. There are three resources to create, a DNS and a link to a private network, and link to a private endpoint
### DNS service
* `res-dns-zone`\
name: 'privatelink.documents.azure.com' should be set to the actual DNS zone we want to use(see microsoft docs). Location has to be global

* Linking private dns zone to vnet

* Add private endpoints

* Link Dns zone to private endpoint

Private endpoints do not work with NSG, so add privateEndpointNetworkPolicies: 'disabled' to each subnet of the private virtualNetwork
